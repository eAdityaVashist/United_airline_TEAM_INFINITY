# ✈️ United Airlines Flight Difficulty Analysis  
### Team Infinity

##  Introduction  

**Customer:** “My flight to Brussels got delayed again! Is this route always this chaotic?”  
**Aditya (Future UA Employee):** “It’s not just bad luck — some flights are naturally harder to manage. Too many transfers, tight schedules, or special requests can make them tricky.”  
**Customer:** “So… you can actually measure how difficult a flight is?”  
**Anshul (Future UA Employee):** “That’s what we’re trying to figure out.”  

This project was born from that very question — *can we quantify flight difficulty?*

## Project Overview  

United Airlines operates thousands of flights every day, each with varying levels of operational complexity.  
This project introduces the **Flight Difficulty Score (FDS)** — a composite metric that measures how challenging a flight is to operate, based on multiple real-world parameters like:  

- Delays and ground time  
- Passenger and baggage load  
- Special Service Requests (SSRs)  
- Transfer-to-checked bag ratios  

By analyzing these factors, we classify each flight as **Easy**, **Medium**, or **Difficult** — helping airlines optimize operations, resource allocation, and scheduling.

##  Dataset Description  

All datasets used are stored in the `Data/` folder.  

| Dataset | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Airports Data** | Airport and country codes |
| **Bags Data** | Transfer and checked baggage details |
| **Flights Data** | Flight schedules, delays, fleet, and carrier |
| **PNR Flight Data** | Passenger details (children, lap infants, etc.) |
| **PNR Remark Data** | Special Service Requests (SSRs) linked to each passenger |

##  Analysis Pipeline  

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
   - Imported and merged all datasets  
   - Converted date/time columns  
   - Handled missing and inconsistent data  

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Calculated new features: delay duration, passenger ratios, ground time flags, SSR counts  
   - Computed a custom **Flight Difficulty Score (FDS)**  

3. **Difficulty Classification**  
   - Ranked flights by daily FDS  
   - Top 20% → **Difficult**  
   - Middle 60% → **Medium**  
   - Bottom 20% → **Easy**  

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution of FDS  
   - Top 10 most difficult flights  
   - Difficult destinations  

5. **Correlation Analysis**  
   - Found relationships between FDS and features like passenger count, delay, SSRs, and baggage ratios

##  Visualizations  

- Histograms showing FDS distribution  
- Bar charts for Top 10 Difficult Flights and Destinations  
- Correlation heatmaps for operational insights  

---

##  Key Insights  

- Most flights have low difficulty scores, with few highly difficult outliers  
- Certain destinations consistently have higher average difficulty  
- Strong correlation observed between:  
  - Passenger count and difficulty  
  - Tight ground time and delay rate  
  - SSR count and overall complexity
